# AI Literacy Implementation: Paid Social Team

## Key Finding

The Paid Social team is primed for AI adoption but stuck in the classic "more work" perception trap. Jeff, Sam, and Abe are already using AI tools individually (ChatGPT, Claude) and understand the potential, but team-wide adoption remains inconsistent. The solution isn't more automationâ€”it's hands-on literacy training that creates immediate "wow moments."

## Current State

**Strengths:**

Managers are AI-forward and part of existing task force

Individual initiative already happening (personal ChatGPT/Claude subscriptions)

Team has responded well to breakout training formats

Google Workspace already provides Gemini 2.5 Pro access

**Challenge:**

Past AI trainings haven't stuck because, as Jeff put it, "We do a great job explaining things. We don't do a great job of follow-up." This hands-on approach flips that.

People view AI as additional work rather than time-saver

Inconsistent adoption across team members

## The Opportunity

**Primary Pain Point:** Creative briefing process currently ranges from 20 minutes (best case) to 2+ hours (typical). Team identified this as their biggest time sink and expressed frustration: "you feel like I can't believe I just put that much time into that."

This challenge is significantly amplified by its cross-departmental nature, heavily impacting not only Paid Media (who often create these briefs) but also the Creative Operations team who receives and executes them, as highlighted in recent discussions with Creative leadership.

**Secondary Wins:** Screenshot analysis, data manipulation in Sheets, Slack summarization, basic reporting automation.

## Recommended Approach

**Hands-On Workshop**

2-hour practical session focused on creative briefing workflow; this workshop should ideally be a collaborative effort, or at minimum, solutions developed should incorporate insights from Paid Media and Creative Operations to ensure a holistic fix for this shared bottleneck.

Manager pre-training, then cascade to team with breakout rooms

Standardize on Gemini 2.5 Pro (eliminate tool friction and additional costs)

Emphasis on immediate value demonstration, not theoretical training

**Success Metric:** Natural adoption driven by experience, not enforcement

## Anticipated Impact

**Time Savings:** Streamlining creative briefing alone could save 1-1.5 hours per brief. With multiple briefs per week per team member, this represents significant efficiency gains. The positive ripple effect of streamlining this process would extend to increased efficiency and potentially higher quality output from the Creative Operations team as well.

**Adoption Catalyst:** Once team experiences genuine time savings on core tasks, adoption becomes self-reinforcing rather than manager-driven.

## Next Steps

Start with single workshop to test approach and measure immediate impact. Based on results, determine scope for additional training modules and potential expansion to other use cases.

**Timeline:** Initial workshop within 2-3 weeks, followed by 30-day adoption assessment.
