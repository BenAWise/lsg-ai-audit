# Creative & Strategy Teams AI Audit: Findings & Recommendations

## Key Finding

This call with Zach Youngblood (Creative Operations Manager) and Griffin Bower (Head of Creative Strategy) revealed significant, actionable AI opportunities, primarily centered around **streamlining the creative briefing process** and enhancing **AI literacy for the creative team**. Both Zach and Griffin expressed openness to AI, with Zach highlighting specific, high-impact pain points where AI could offer immediate relief. There's a clear desire for practical, hands-on AI applications rather than theoretical overviews. A secondary, but important, theme was the inconsistent use of AI tools across teams and an opportunity to standardize and leverage existing resources (like Google's Gemini) more effectively.

**Current State**

**AI Awareness & Usage:**

Zach Youngblood's (Creative Operations Manager) team actively uses ChatGPT (company-paid "Teams" tier) for tasks like brand website scraping and exploring image generation (noting limitations for final ad production but using it for mockups/backgrounds). They lack a standardized process or deep prompting expertise.

Griffin Bower (Head of Creative Strategy) is personally curious, has experimented with custom GPTs (e.g., Flora), and his team uses AI, but it's not a standard process.

An existing knowledge base in Trainual with some prompts has varied usage.

**Challenges:**

A key challenge is the perception of AI as "more work" rather than a time-saver.

Training needs to "stick" by demonstrating immediate, tangible value.

Inconsistent use of AI tools across teams.

**Tooling:**

LSG pays for ChatGPT Teams for Zach's creative team.

LSG has Google Workspace (providing access to Gemini 1.5 Pro Preview, though Zach had issues with it for Google Sheets formulas).

Some individuals (like Griffin) use other tools like Claude (free version for prompt generation).

## The Opportunity

**Streamlining the Creative Briefing Process (High Priority - Cross-Departmental Impact):**

**Primary Pain Point:** Identified by Zach (and echoed from Paid Social team discussions) as a major bottleneck. The current Foreplay process is time-consuming for Paid Media (20 mins to 2+ hours per brief), especially for creative concepting, copywriting, and manual data entry.

**Opportunity (Automation & Augmentation):**

Develop an AI-assisted system (e.g., custom GPT, structured prompts) for concept and copy generation (based on client goals/past performance data).

Use AI to analyze performance data (e.g., from Motion reports) to inform testing strategy and creative briefs.

Explore streamlined brief formatting/output (potentially outside Foreplay, e.g., Google Slide/PDF integrated with ClickUp). Zach is open to alternatives.

**Zach's Vision:** A system that takes client goals/context and outputs well-structured, actionable briefs for designers.

**Enhancing AI Literacy & Practical Skills (Creative Team - Zach Youngblood):**

**Needs:** Better prompt engineering skills (especially for imagery, though acknowledging limitations); efficient training for custom GPTs (e.g., for brand expertise, on-brand backgrounds); hands-on workshops with real brand work; AI for ad copy information hierarchy suggestions (a strong text-based use case identified by Zach, e.g., feed raw copy â†’ AI returns which words to bold, which to shrink, CTA placement, etc.).

**Opportunity (Training & Enablement):** Conduct hands-on workshops focusing on advanced prompting, custom GPT creation, AI for copy analysis/hierarchy, and feasible on-brand visual element generation. Focus on "wow moments" and immediate value.

**AI for Creative Strategy (Griffin Bower's Team):**

**Need:** Providing effective creative strategy for all client tiers, even those without a dedicated strategist.

**Opportunity:** Develop custom GPTs trained on individual client context (brand guidelines, performance, goals) to provide thought-starters and accelerate strategy development, enabling broader client support.

**Tool Standardization & Workflow Optimization:**

**Need:** Multiple AI tools in use (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) with some redundancy. Zach expressed interest in learning Zapier for automations.

**Opportunity:** Evaluate standardizing on fewer tools (e.g., maximizing Gemini) for better collaboration and cost-effectiveness. Provide Zapier training (Zach requested for Harvest to Google Sheets).

**Improving Asset Output Tracking (Zach Youngblood):**

**Need:** Current custom API between Air (DAM) and ClickUp for tracking creative asset output is inefficient and requires significant manual input.

**Opportunity:** Investigate AI or a robust automation workflow (e.g., Zapier) to streamline this (Zach's second highest priority).

## Recommended Approach

**Prioritize Creative Briefing Enhancement (Immediate Focus):**

Initiate a focused project for an AI-assisted workflow for creative concepting and copywriting.

Collaborate closely with Paid Media and Zach's Creative team.

Leverage existing AI tools (ChatGPT/Gemini) and potentially Zapier.

Aim for a system that significantly reduces manual effort and outputs clear, actionable briefs.

**Conduct Hands-On AI Literacy Workshops for the Creative Team:**

Schedule a 2-hour workshop for Zach's team focusing on practical prompt engineering, custom GPT creation (using their brands as examples), and AI for copy analysis/information hierarchy.

Goal: Empower creatives, make their work easier/impactful, and foster organic adoption.

**Explore Zapier/Automation Training for Zach Youngblood:**

Discuss dedicated training/support for Zach to build automations (starting with Harvest to Google Sheets).

**Further Discovery on Asset Output Tracking:**

Schedule a follow-up with Zach to understand the Air-to-ClickUp process and explore AI/automation solutions.

**Address Tooling Strategy:**

Facilitate a discussion with stakeholders on the AI tool landscape (ChatGPT Teams, Gemini) for cost-effectiveness and standardization.

## Anticipated Impact

Significant time savings in the creative briefing process (benefiting Paid Media and Creative teams).

Increased AI proficiency and enthusiasm within the Creative team, leading to more innovative and efficient production.

Improved operational efficiency via targeted automations (e.g., output tracking, Zapier).

Enhanced strategic capabilities for the Strategy team through AI leverage.

Better internal collaboration via shared understanding and use of AI tools.

## Next Steps

Approve project for AI-assisted creative briefing.

AI literacy workshop for the Creative team.

Discovery for Zapier training (Zach Youngblood) and asset tracking automation.

Discussion on AI tool standardization.
