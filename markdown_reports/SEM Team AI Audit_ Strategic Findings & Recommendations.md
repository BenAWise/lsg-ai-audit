# SEM Team AI Audit: Strategic Findings & Recommendations

**To:** Jesse DeBear
 **From:** Ben Wise
 **Re:** SEM AI Literacy Opportunity
 **Date:** May 29, 2025

## Key Finding

Your SEM team (30-40 people) is manually reviewing up to 40,000 keywords per week while barely touching AI. Robert Browning, who uses it most, describes his usage as "sparingly." They're ready for hands-on training but need specific prompts and playbooks, not AI theory.

## Current State Assessment

Met with Robert Browning, an SEM director who reports to Heather. Three critical observations:

**Outdated mental models:** Team thinks AI is still "hallucinating and can't hold conversation" like a year ago. Most stuck on ChatGPT, unaware Gemini can crawl the web and pull real-time competitor data.


**Manual processes eating time:** Teams reviewing 40K keywords weekly for negation, manually adjusting budgets daily, and asking clients for competitor lists instead of using AI research.


**Robert already seeing wins:** Created a competitor analysis matrix with product comparisons and suggested ad copy that "barely needs touched." Uses Gemini to pull competitor criticisms and pain points. But this knowledge isn't spreading.


## The Opportunity

This isn't about automation or complex tools. It's about teaching 40 people to save 2-3 hours per week each on tasks they're already doing. Conservative math: 80-120 hours weekly productivity gain across the team.

Robert nailed it: "I don't think in their minds they know how much time it's gonna shave off... they'll need to experience it themselves."

And here's what's smart - Robert sees the force multiplier opportunity. He explained it perfectly: "I think it's more about the force multiplier fact... how can I create a set of instructions to multiply this work across" multiple accounts through VAs and junior staff. That's the kind of strategic thinking we want to spread.

## Recommended Approach

**Hands-on workshop (2-3 hours) focused on four specific use cases:**

**Competitor research matrices** - Pull competitor products, USPs, and ad copy suggestions in minutes vs. hours

**Bulk keyword categorization** - Feed 1000s of search terms, get relevance scoring for negation

**Data analysis beyond "surface level"** - Actual prompts for meaningful CSV insights

**Delegation prompts for VAs** - Multiply senior strategists' impact through junior staff

**Immediate quick win:** Create a library of 5-10 Google Ads scripts for common tasks (Robert identified this as "very low hanging fruit"). Store in Google Drive/ClickUp for easy access. This delivers value in week 1 while workshop planning happens.

Deliverable: "Recipe book" of copy-paste prompts they can modify. Not theory - actual templates for tasks they'll do tomorrow.

## Why This Will Stick

Three factors make this different from typical AI training:

**Prescriptive guidance:** Robert was clear - people want "4-5 sentences where they can replace subjects and nouns." They need a playbook, not principles.


**Force multiplier mindset:** Robert gets that it's not about doing one task faster, it's about implementing strategies across multiple accounts through delegation.


**Team readiness:** As Robert put it: "if we get them interested in it and give them digestible pieces, they will love it." They're not resistant, just unaware.


## Anticipated Impact

**Week 1-2:** Script library launches, early adopters (5-6 people) start using competitor research and keyword categorization

**Week 3-4:** Internal Slack channel gets active as people share prompt variations

**Month 2:** VAs handling routine analysis tasks, strategists focus on optimization

**Month 3:** Team creating deliverables competitors can't match (like Robert's matrices)

You mentioned 100-150 hours/week potential on reporting automation alone. SEM could deliver similar scale - they just need to know what's possible.

## Next Steps

**Schedule 2-3 hour hands-on workshop** for SEM team

**Create prompt playbook** for their top 4 use cases (I'll develop based on Robert's input)

**2-week follow-up assessment** to measure adoption and refine approach

**Roll successful model to other teams**

Robert already gets it. He's creating competitor matrices that wow clients. Imagine 40 people with that capability.

Ready to discuss workshop timing.
